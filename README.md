# 🎮 Work From Fun

Because sometimes you need to look busy while doing absolutely nothing.

## 🤔 What is this?

Work From Fun is a totally-not-suspicious automation tool that keeps your computer looking active while you're:
- 🛋️ Power napping on the couch
- 🌮 Making that important taco run
- 🐈 Petting your cat (this is actually important business)
- 🎮 "Reviewing competitive market strategies" (gaming)
- ☕ Getting your 7th coffee of the day

## 🚀 Features

- Random mouse movements (looks totally human, trust me)
- Random keystrokes (very professional, much typing)
- Zero productivity enhancement (that's a feature, not a bug)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
bun i
```

## 🎯 Usage

```bash
bun start
```

Then walk away and let the magic happen! Your computer will look super busy doing important things.
